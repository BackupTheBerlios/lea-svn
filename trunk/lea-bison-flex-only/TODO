TODO List
#########


The structure of our language processor, our interpreter, is the following:

User-input/code ---strings----> 

	lexical analyzer ----tokens--->
		
		grammatical parser ----structures---->
			
			tree generator ----parse-tree/symbol-table---->
				
				execution unit.


1. Lexical analyzer
###################
 ----> Mostly done
 @ The Linux/UNIX scripting capability is badly implemented
	Needs to be implemented so that it can only be recognized if it's in the first line of a file being executed
	via Linux directly (i.e. ./<script-name>)

 @ No error recovery yet
	Where possible, errors should be automatically recovered - For example a syntaxical error in a sentence
	shouldn't stop the next sentence from being executed. It should also show the user exactly which are the
	problematic lines and show as much hints as we can provide to allow him to quickly detect which was the
	error.
 @ Support debuggers ?
	We haven't got even error recovery yet at all. So this is still an utopia. But needs to be kept in mind so
	that it doesn't turn an huge task of code refactoring to implement in the end. 

2. Grammatical parser
#####################
 ----> Mostly done
 @ No error recovery yet
	Pretty similar problem as in the Lexical parser, applied to gramatics.
	
 @ Support debuggers ?
 	Idem as in the Lexical Parser analogue point.

 @ Some gramatical checks are not being done here
	This is not something I feel that needs to be fixed, but just to talk about it a bit and decide if it's the
	actually the best way to do. There are some grammatical structure checks (being the mult_assign_statement
	the most remarkable) that are just not being done by the the parser. The main reason behind this decission
	is that this way it's easier to reuse other rules, and thus code it's probably more readeable. In the other
	hand, we'll need to check that this grammar exceptions in the tree-generator code
